What is this?
=============

Get Books is a book browser and downloader.

How to use?
===========

Start, select a catalog, then browse the books.  Try a search.  Currently the only library supported is
the Internet Archive. Feedbooks is going out of business soon, and their ODPS catalog no longer works.

In addition to browsing the Internet Archive catalogs, you can view the books in your Journal and add
PDFs and EPUBs on thumb drives to that Journal.

Get Books is not a part of Sugar desktop, but is often added.  Please refer to;

On Sugar desktop systems;
* use [My Settings](https://help.sugarlabs.org/en/my_settings.html), [Software Update](https://help.sugarlabs.org/en/my_settings.html#software-update), or;
* use Browse to open [activities.sugarlabs.org](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/), search for `Get Books`, then download.

How to integrate?
=================
