Feedbooks is going out of business soon and its OPDS feed is no more. I tried
several other OPDS feeds from this list: http://opdshome.uo1.net/ including
the one from Project Gutenberg and found them all to be unsatisfactory for
one reason or another. OPDS catalogs are not standardized as much as they could
be.

* Upgrade to a newer version of feedparser.py.
* Make feedparser.py work with Python3.
* Add sgmllib3.py which was included with feedparser.
* Make search criteria for Internet Archive match what is in GetIABooks Activity.
